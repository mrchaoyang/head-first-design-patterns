# Head-First-Design-Patterns
Code for the book Head First Design Patterns by Eric Freeman &amp; Elizabeth Freeman


## Forked from 
https://github.com/rowin1/Head-First-Design-Patterns

It looks like the same as the ones recommended from O'Reilly's book page.


## Changes
My mavenization may not be approved of by the github repo's author, hence this forked repo

* add pom.xml, .gitignore
* update code structure to follow maven convention
* add package names to each class
* correct some coding errors
    (file name/class mismatch, missing returns, etc.)


## Run with
```
mvn clean install
```
